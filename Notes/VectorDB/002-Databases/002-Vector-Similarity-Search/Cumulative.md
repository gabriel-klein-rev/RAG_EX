#### Description:

**Performing Vector Similarity Search:**
- Use the cosine similarity formula to find vectors that are similar to a given query vector.
- Normalize vectors to unit vectors before calculating cosine similarity.

```python
import sqlite3
import numpy as np
from sklearn.metrics.pairwise import cosine_similarity

# Connect to SQLite database
conn = sqlite3.connect("vector_database.db")
cursor = conn.cursor()

# Assume 'query_vector' is the vector for which similarity search is performed
query_vector = np.array([0.2, 0.3, 0.4])

# Fetch all vectors from the table
cursor.execute('SELECT id, vector_data FROM vector_table')
rows = cursor.fetchall()

# Convert fetched vectors to numpy arrays
stored_vectors = [np.array(list(map(float, row[1].split(',')))) for row in rows]

# Normalize vectors to unit vectors
normalized_vectors = [vector / np.linalg.norm(vector) for vector in stored_vectors]
normalized_query_vector = query_vector / np.linalg.norm(query_vector)

# Calculate cosine similarity between the query vector and stored vectors
similarities = cosine_similarity([normalized_query_vector], normalized_vectors)

# Find the indices of the top-k similar vectors
top_k_indices = np.argsort(similarities[0])[::-1][:5]

# Retrieve the top-k similar vectors
similar_vectors = [stored_vectors[i] for i in top_k_indices]

print("Similar vectors:", similar_vectors)

# Close the connection
conn.close()
```

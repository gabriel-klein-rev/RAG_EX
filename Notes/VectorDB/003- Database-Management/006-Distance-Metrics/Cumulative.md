#### Description:

**1. Importance of Distance Metrics:**
   - Distance metrics quantify the similarity or dissimilarity between vectors.
   - They are fundamental for performing vector similarity searches and clustering in vector databases.

**2. Common Distance Metrics:**
   - **Euclidean Distance:** Measures the straight-line distance between two points in Euclidean space.
   - **Cosine Similarity:** Measures the cosine of the angle between two vectors, providing a measure of similarity.
   - **Manhattan Distance (L1 Norm):** Measures the sum of absolute differences between corresponding coordinates of two vectors.
   - **Jaccard Similarity:** Measures the size of the intersection of sets divided by the size of the union of sets.

**3. Characteristics of Distance Metrics:**
   - **Scale Sensitivity:** Some metrics are sensitive to the scale of the data (e.g., Euclidean distance), while others are scale-invariant (e.g., cosine similarity).
   - **Angular Sensitivity:** Metrics like cosine similarity focus on the angle between vectors, making them robust to magnitude differences.
   - **Computation Complexity:** Different metrics have varying computational complexities, influencing query performance.

**4. Use Cases for Distance Metrics:**
   - **Image Similarity Search:** Cosine similarity is often suitable for comparing image vectors.
   - **Textual Document Retrieval:** Jaccard similarity may be useful for measuring document similarity based on word occurrences.
   - **Anomaly Detection:** Euclidean distance or Manhattan distance can be applied for detecting outliers in vector data.

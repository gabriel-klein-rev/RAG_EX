#### Description:

**1. Purpose of Upsert in Vector Databases:**
   - Upsert operations streamline the process of updating existing vector records or inserting new ones based on specific conditions.
   - This helps ensure data consistency and simplifies the handling of data changes.

**2. Common Techniques for Upsert:**
   - **Insert or Update Statements:** Execute an "INSERT" statement, and if a conflict (e.g., duplicate key) arises, handle it by updating the existing record.

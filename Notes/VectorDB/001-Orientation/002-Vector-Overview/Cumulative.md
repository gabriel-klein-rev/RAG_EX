## Vectors in Database:

- In the context of a vector database, data entities are represented as vectors.
- Each vector corresponds to a multi-dimensional point in a vector space.
- Vectors encapsulate the essential characteristics or features of the data.

## Data Representation:

- Vector databases leverage vectors to represent complex data structures.
- Vectors can represent diverse data types, including numerical, textual, or categorical data.
- The arrangement of vector elements captures the relationships within the data.

## Vector Similarity:

- Vector similarity is a crucial concept in vector databases.
- Similarity measures (e.g., cosine similarity) quantify the resemblance between vectors.
- Operations like similarity search enable efficient retrieval of similar vectors.

## Similarity Search using Vectors:

- Having vectorized data allows the querying of similar vector data using distance metrics
- These distance metrics can include Cosine similarity, Euclidean Distance, etc.

## Image Retrieval in Vector Databases:

- Illustrative Example: Storing and retrieving images based on their visual features.
- Each image is represented as a vector capturing pixel values or deep learning embeddings.
- Similarity search helps find images with visual similarities efficiently.

Vector Representation in SQLite (Python Example):

python
```python
import sqlite3
import numpy as np

# Connect to SQLite database (or create a new one)
conn = sqlite3.connect("vector_database.db")
cursor = conn.cursor()

# Create a table to store vectors
cursor.execute('''
    CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS vectors (
        id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
        embedding TEXT
    )
''')

# Assume 'vectors' is a list of vectors
vectors = [[0.1, 0.2, 0.3], [0.4, 0.5, 0.6]]

# Convert vectors to string format for storage
vector_strings = [",".join(map(str, vector)) for vector in vectors]

# Insert vectors into the table
for vector_string in vector_strings:
    cursor.execute('INSERT INTO vectors (embedding) VALUES (?)', (vector_string,))

```
Similarity Search (Python Example):

python
```PYTHON
from sklearn.metrics.pairwise import cosine_similarity

# Assume 'query_vector' is the vector for which similarity search is performed
query_vector = np.array([0.2, 0.3, 0.4])

# Fetch all vectors from the table
cursor.execute('SELECT id, embedding FROM vectors')
rows = cursor.fetchall()

# Convert fetched vectors to numpy arrays
stored_vectors = [np.array(list(map(float, row[1].split(',')))) for row in rows]

# Calculate cosine similarity between the query vector and stored vectors
similarities = cosine_similarity([query_vector], stored_vectors)

# Find the indices of the top-k similar vectors
top_k_indices = np.argsort(similarities[0])[::-1][:5]

# Retrieve the top-k similar vectors
similar_vectors = [stored_vectors[i] for i in top_k_indices]

print("Similar vectors:", similar_vectors)

# Commit the changes
conn.commit()

# Close the connection
conn.close()

```

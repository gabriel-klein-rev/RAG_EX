#### Description:

**1. Purpose of Metadata Processing:**
   - Metadata processing involves handling additional information related to the data being stored in vector databases.
   - It provides context, categorization, or descriptive attributes that enhance the understanding and usability of the data.

**2. Common Types of Metadata:**
   - **Descriptive Metadata:**
     - Provides information about the content, context, or purpose of the data.
     - Examples: Title, description, keywords.
   - **Structural Metadata:**
     - Describes the structure or organization of the data.
     - Examples: Data format, schema, relationships.
   - **Administrative Metadata:**
     - Includes information about data ownership, access permissions, or other administrative details.
     - Examples: Author, creation date, access permissions.

**3. Integration with Vector Databases:**
   - **Association with Vector Data:**
     - Associate metadata with vector representations of data points.
     - Embed metadata directly into the vector database alongside the corresponding vectors.
   - **Indexing and Querying:**
     - Index metadata attributes for efficient querying.
     - Utilize metadata in search queries to filter and retrieve relevant data.

**4. Strategies for Handling Metadata:**
   - **Standardization:** Define standard formats or schemas for metadata to ensure consistency.
   - **Enrichment:** Enhance vectorized data with additional metadata to provide more context.
   - **Versioning:** Implement versioning for metadata to track changes over time.
   - **Privacy Considerations:** Handle sensitive metadata with privacy considerations.

#### Example Code (using Python and a Hypothetical Vector Database Library):

```python
import vector_db_library as vdb

# Example: Adding metadata to vector data in a hypothetical vector database
vector_db = vdb.VectorDatabase()

# Vector data (e.g., embeddings)
vectors = [[0.1, 0.2, 0.3], [0.4, 0.5, 0.6]]

# Metadata associated with each vector
metadata = [{"title": "Document A", "category": "Text"}, {"title": "Image B", "category": "Image"}]

# Inserting vectors and metadata into the vector database
vector_db.insert(vectors, metadata)

# Querying vectors with metadata
query_result = vector_db.query({"category": "Text"})
print("Vectors with category 'Text':", query_result)
```

#### Real World Application:

**Media Library Management System:**
   - **Scenario:** Managing a media library with various types of content.
   - **Metadata Processing:**
     - Associate metadata such as title, genre, and creator with each vectorized content.
     - Use metadata for efficient retrieval and categorization.

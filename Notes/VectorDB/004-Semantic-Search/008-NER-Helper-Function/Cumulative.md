#### Description:

**1. Purpose of an NER Helper Function:**
   - An NER helper function is designed to automate the extraction of named entities from text data.
   - It simplifies the process of applying NER to unstructured text and obtaining structured information.

**2. Components of the NER Helper Function:**
   - **Input:** Accepts a text input for NER analysis.
   - **NER Model:** Utilizes a pre-trained NER model or library for entity extraction.
   - **Output:** Returns a structured representation of identified named entities (e.g., entities and their types).

**3. Steps in the NER Helper Function:**
   - **Tokenization:** Break down the input text into tokens (words, phrases) for NER analysis.
   - **NER Analysis:** Apply the pre-trained NER model to identify named entities.
   - **Formatting:** Structure the identified entities with their corresponding types.
   - **Output:** Return the structured representation of named entities.

**4. Integration with Text Data Preprocessing:**
   - Incorporate the NER helper function into the text data preprocessing pipeline.
   - Apply the function to extract named entities before further processing or vectorization.

**5. Considerations for NER Model:**
   - Choose an NER model or library suitable for the specific application.
   - Ensure the model has been trained on relevant entity types for the task at hand.

#### Example Code (using spaCy):

```python
import spacy

def ner_helper(text):
    # Load spaCy NER model
    nlp = spacy.load("en_core_web_sm")
    
    # Process the text with the NER model
    doc = nlp(text)
    
    # Extract named entities and their types
    entities = [{"text": ent.text, "type": ent.label_} for ent in doc.ents]
    
    return entities

# Example usage:
text_example = "Apple Inc. was founded by Steve Jobs in Cupertino."
named_entities = ner_helper(text_example)
print(named_entities)
```

#### Real World Application:

**News Article Processing System:**
   - **Scenario:** Analyzing news articles for relevant information.
   - **Integration:**
     - Apply the NER helper function to extract entities such as persons, organizations, and locations.
     - Use the extracted entities for further analysis or indexing in a vector database.

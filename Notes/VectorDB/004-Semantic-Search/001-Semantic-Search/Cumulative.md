#### Description:

**1. Purpose of Semantic Search:**
   - Semantic search aims to improve the relevance of search results by understanding the meaning behind user queries.
   - In vector databases, semantic search relies on vector representations that capture semantic relationships between data points.

**2. Techniques for Semantic Search:**
   - **Word Embeddings:** Represent words as vectors in a semantic space, capturing semantic similarities.
   - **Phrase Embeddings:** Extend semantic representations to phrases or sentences for more context-aware search.
   - **Knowledge Graph Embeddings:** Represent entities and relationships in a knowledge graph as vectors for semantic search.

**3. Implementation of Semantic Search:**
   - **Vector Representations:** Encode data points (documents, entities, etc.) as vectors using techniques like Word2Vec, GloVe, or deep learning embeddings.
   - **Query Embeddings:** Represent user queries as vectors to capture semantic meaning.
   - **Similarity Measures:** Use distance metrics or similarity measures (e.g., cosine similarity) to find semantically similar vectors.

**4. Use Cases for Semantic Search:**
   - **Document Retrieval:** Retrieve documents based on their semantic relevance to a user's query.
   - **Entity Search:** Find entities or objects that are semantically related to a given concept.
   - **Question Answering:** Provide answers to user queries by understanding the semantic context.

#### Real World Application:

**Medical Literature Search:**
   - **Scenario:** Searching a medical literature database for relevant research papers.
   - **Semantic Search Implementation:**
     - Represent research papers as vectors using document embeddings.
     - Use semantic search to retrieve papers relevant to a user's medical query.

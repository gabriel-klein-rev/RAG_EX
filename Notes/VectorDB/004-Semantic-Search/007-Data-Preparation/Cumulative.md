#### Description:

**1. Purpose of Data Preparation for Vector Embedding:**
   - Data preparation ensures that raw data is transformed into a format suitable for training and using vector embedding models.
   - It involves cleaning, encoding, and structuring data to capture meaningful semantic relationships.

**2. Common Data Preparation Steps:**
   - **Text Data:**
     - **Tokenization:** Break text into tokens (words, phrases) for embedding.
     - **Cleaning:** Remove stop words, punctuation, and irrelevant characters.
     - **Padding/Truncation:** Adjust the length of sequences to a uniform size.
   - **Image Data:**
     - **Resizing:** Ensure images are of consistent dimensions for processing.
     - **Normalization:** Scale pixel values to a standard range.
   - **Graph Data:**
     - **Node and Edge Encoding:** Encode nodes and edges for graph-based embeddings.
   - **Time-Series Data:**
     - **Resampling:** Adjust temporal granularity if needed.
     - **Feature Engineering:** Extract relevant features for embedding.

**3. Handling Categorical Variables:**
   - Encode categorical variables using techniques like one-hot encoding or embeddings.
   - Ensure that categorical variables are represented in a way that captures their semantic relationships.

**4. Training and Validation Split:**
   - Split the dataset into training and validation sets to assess model generalization.
   - Shuffle the data to avoid biases introduced by the order of the records.

**5. Optimizing for Model Performance:**
   - Balance class distribution to prevent the model from favoring dominant classes.
   - Address issues like class imbalance, outliers, and missing values.
